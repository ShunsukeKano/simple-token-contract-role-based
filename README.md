# SimpleToken Contract with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
This smart contract instructs students to develop a SimpleToken contract incorporating RBAC principles. The contract must feature three state variables: 'owner' (address), 'balances' (mapping), and 'denylisted' (mapping), where 'balances' tracks the balance of all accounts and 'denylisted' notes if an account is denylisted or not. A constructor is to initialize the 'owner' with the contract creator's address and assign a non-zero token balance to the 'owner' using 'balances'. Two custom modifiers, 'not_denylisted' and 'at_least' (with an uint argument), are to be defined to check if the sender is not denylisted and if they possess sufficient funds for transfer, respectively. A function 'denylist()' is to switch a non-denylisted account to a denylisted one, which can only be accessed by the 'owner'. Finally, a 'transfer' function is required that facilitates token transfers between accounts, which must be secured by the aforementioned modifiers to prevent transfers from accounts with insufficient funds and ensure the sender's account is not denylisted.
